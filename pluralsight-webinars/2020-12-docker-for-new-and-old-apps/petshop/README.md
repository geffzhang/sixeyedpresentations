# Packaging WCF Apps in Docker

This is cut from the full repo: [sixeyed/petshopvnext](https://github.com/sixeyed/petshopvnext/tree/master).

These example Dockerfiles use pre-built zip files to deploy the apps, demonstrating you can move apps to Windows containers without changing code.

There's also a branch of the repo which evolves the source code to migrate to Cosmos DB: [sixeyed/petshopvnext @dotnetconf2020](https://github.com/sixeyed/petshopvnext/tree/dotnetconf2020).
